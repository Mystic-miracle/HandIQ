# HandIQ
An LLM based app that lets you interact with your handwritten documents.




Firstly here is a little architecture diagram to help you wrap your head around this simple (but not easy ) to implement architecture.

AS you can see we have a little CLoud vision API (you can modify it to use your your trained models ) to detect handwritten texts and the chunks hence generated are fed to the LLM(the heart of your app)
